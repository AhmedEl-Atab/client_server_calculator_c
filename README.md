This is a simple calculator program with client server architecture using the TCP protocol and socket technology.

This calculator can handle the basic arithmetic calculations (+,-,*,/,power).

This server supports multi-client. This is cheived using the fork() command.

This program works fine on Linux, Unix and there derivatives.

Also it runs normally on Windows but using a special compiler which is "Cygwin" which can interpret Linux and Unix commands such as "fork()", or you have to edit the code to remove the the related "fork()" commands.

This program was tested on Windows 8.1 Pro with Code::Blocks IDE using Cygwin compiler.
